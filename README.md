This is my effort to get my 3d models displayed on a website that I can then visit, and move around in VR or WASD controls on Desktop.

- can this scene be baked (with animations) for an utterly massive performance boost, and then have navmeshes, and interactivity applied after?


OVERALL OBJECTIVES

1. navigation with wasd keyboard or oculus thumbsticks and teleport
2. advanced animation of models. pbr model integration and its effect on framerate
3. Animated giffs with transparencies in 3d space. this will help https://jsfiddle.net/Lwtzjnk9/1/
4. nav meshes and collision detection
5. event listeners on objects (selected by raycasting, viewpoint selection(nts find out the term for that) or mouseclick
6. links to other scenes
7. positional audio
8. animated video hdri/skybox - this is going to be complicated - see about seamless textures and particle generators in blender. finding free equirectangular images is a nightmare. This will help https://github.com/Dante83/A-Starry-Sky?tab=readme-ov-file = you will need 1.3.0 though.
9. networking with other users utilizing relevant technologies via cdns and API's
10. Integration of point scans. the workflow required to get a low poly with a high poly bake
11. scene optimization, for both webxr/aframe and unity. it must run on a potato
12. open windows in vr mode? (https://ur0.jp/oVX2d)
